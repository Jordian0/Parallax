    <h2>Parallax Effect</h2>
    <p>The parallax effect is a visual technique used in web design (and other media) where background elements move at a different speed than foreground elements as the user scrolls or navigates through a website. This creates an illusion of depth and adds a sense of immersion and interactivity to the web page.<br>
    In the context of web design, the parallax effect is often achieved by having multiple layers of images or elements positioned at different depths on the page. As the user scrolls, these layers move at different rates, creating a 3D-like effect.<br><br>
    There are different types of parallax effects:<br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <u>Layered Parallax</u>: This involves stacking multiple layers of images or elements, and as the user scrolls, the foreground and background move at different speeds, creating depth perception.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Reveal Parallax</u>: Elements or images are revealed or animated as the user scrolls down the page, creating a storytelling effect or revealing content in an engaging manner.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Mouse Movement Parallax</u>: Elements on the page move or respond based on the user's mouse movement, giving the illusion of depth and interactivity.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Reveal Parallax Effect</h2>
    <p>Reveal parallax is a type of parallax effect used in web design where elements or content are progressively revealed or animated as the user scrolls down the web page. This technique is employed to engage users by creating a storytelling experience or presenting content in a dynamic and visually appealing way.<br>
    In a reveal parallax effect, various elements (such as images, text, graphics, or animations) are initially hidden or partially obscured from view. As the user scrolls down the page, these elements come into view or are unveiled in a sequential or animated manner.<br>    
    The purpose of using reveal parallax is to guide the user's attention and create a narrative flow by presenting information in a captivating and interactive way. This effect can add depth and visual interest to a website, making the browsing experience more engaging and memorable.<br>
    Designers often use this technique for storytelling websites, product showcases, portfolios, or landing pages to showcase key features, details, or a sequence of events. By revealing content progressively as users scroll, it encourages them to explore further and enhances the overall user experience.
